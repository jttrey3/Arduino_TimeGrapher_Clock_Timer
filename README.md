# Arduino_TimeGrapher_Clock_Timer

## Summary
  This is my attemp to create an Arduino based tool for measuring the beat of a clock with the following features:
  * Listen to the tic/tock of the clock
  * Measure the time in between
  * Evaluate the "evenness" or beat of the clock
  * Calculate the measured beats per hour (BPH)
  * Track BPH over time
  * Using optical sensor, determine the "proper" BPH for any movement by the motion of the minute hand
  * Log data to SD Card
  * Optional:
    * Evaluate strike/chime operations (Details to be worked out)

## Hardware elements
  * Foundation
  * Arduino
  * Sound sensor?  Maybe piezo?
  * Display
  * Real Time Clock (RTC)
  * Photo interrupter
  * SD Card Module
  * Power Source
  * Button

## Software Milestones
  1. TBD
